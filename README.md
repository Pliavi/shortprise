## Introduction

I was looking for a service to create a way to redirect users to a random website on my portfolio, and I haven't found any, so I decided to create one!

And here it its! Now me and you can redirect your users to any website you want! ðŸŽ‰

Using one single link, you can redirect to a random url from a list you provide or use it as a common shortener site providing only one url.

And you decide the way the urls will roll, randomly or sequentially, it's up to you! ðŸ«µ

## Run it locally

To run it locally, use the following command:

```bash
# using npm
npm install && npm run dev

# using yarn
yarn install && yarn dev

# using pnpm
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

And access at `http://localhost:3000`
